Design adjustments needed:

1. make three_port_ram collision tolerant by changing read to write when there's r/w collision
2. add additional row and col processor output for when the multiplier and multiplicant is valid
   to make up for FIFO latency
3. add ve_ack to row processor to make up for memory latency
